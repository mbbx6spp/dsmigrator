Support for different datastores\r\nwill be offered via plugin capability.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nWORK IN PROGRESS\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nTo provide a way to:\r\n\r\n* declaratively define schema *migrations*\r\n* define *plan* which can be per environment\r\n* detect *status* of *plan* for a *target*\r\n* run *plan* of *migrations* against a *target*\r\n\r\n## Terminology\r\n\r\n* *Schema:* construct in a datastore providing structure for data, e.g. index\r\n  with mappings in a search engine like ElasticSearch, table with columns and/or\r\n  column families in HBase, etc.\r\n* *Migration:* atomic unit of change\r\n* *Plan:* sequence of migrations\r\n* *Status:* report identifying what migrations have been applied and what are pending\r\n* *Target:* specific datastore typically represented by a URL\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nThis is a project basically at it's inception so there is a lot to do before\r\nwe get the first working version shipped. Namely:\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1 should have the ability to do the following:\r\n\r\n* Provide Scala API to declaratively define migrations\r\n* Provide Scala API to declaratively define plans\r\n* Report status of a plan for the given target\r\n* Run plan of migrations against a target\r\n* Implement migration runner for HBase\r\n\r\nVersion 0.2 should have the following capabilities in addition to 0.1:\r\n\r\n* Implement migration runner for ElasticSearch 0.9.x/1.x\r\n* Provide Java-compatible API to define migrations\r\n* Provide Java-compatible API to defined plans\r\n\r\nTODO define next version milestones.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis software is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license.
